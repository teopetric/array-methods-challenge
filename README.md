# Fork and Pull Request

### 1. Fork the project to your github account
Press the 'Fork' button in the upper right corner, a copy of the repo will then be made and you will be redirected to it.
You can verify that by looking in the upper left corner, you should see something like "YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME/carrot-store-challenge".

### 2. Clone the project locally
You can press the green "Clone or download" button and copy the link, then use 'git clone LINK_HERE' command to get a local copy.

### 3. (Optional) Make a branch with your name
It's good practice to not work directly on the master branch, you can make a branch with your own name and work there or even make 
different branches for every feature you make if you feel brave.
 
You can see the local/remote branches that exists typing "git branch -a" in your terminal/bash or from the "Branch :" dropdown menu 
on the project's github page.

### 4. Make changes and commit
It's encouraged and good practice to have small commits (atomics), so it's easier to track/revert changes in the code when necessary.

### 5. Pull request
When you are ready you can press the "New pull request" on *your* repo page and from there select:
 * Base repository - "iQ-University/carrot-store-challenge"
 * Base - The branch with your name
 * Head repository - "YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME/carrot-store-challenge"
 * Compare - The branch you worked on
